### 5. How to write an effective prompt  
An OpenAI co-founder, and currently the organizationâ€™s president, Brockman is an ideal expert to offer such advice. Helpfully, he recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the basic structure of the perfect AI prompt. Originally developed by engineer and AI company founder Ben Hylak, this formula breaks down the ideal AI prompt into four sections. 
#### Define Your Goal  
Clearly state what you want AI to generate. Be specific for better results.  
*Example: "List of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco, focusing on unique and lesser-known trails."* 

#### Specify Output Format  
Define how you want the response structured.  
*Example: "Provide hike name (as found on AllTrails), start & end address, distance, drive time, duration, and what makes it unique."*

#### Set Constraints & Warnings  
Prevent AI hallucinations by setting guidelines.  
*Example: "Ensure the trail name is correct, exists, and time estimates are accurate."*  

### Provide Context  
Give additional background to improve relevance.  
*Example: "We are experienced hikers, have done all common trails, loved Mt. Tam for the breakfast at the end, and prefer ocean views."*

#### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways  
- More details = better responses.  
- Think of AI as a humanâ€”it works best when you communicate naturally.  
- Experiment with AI tools to refine your prompting skills.
